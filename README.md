# Sentiment-analysis---Text-clustering---Summarization
This project includes the following steps:
Step 1: Import necessary libraries
Step 2: Read text files, structure them into rows, and create a DataFrame
Step 3: Apply sentiment analysis on the text and add the results as a new column
Step 4: Evaluate sentiment predictions against actual sentiment labels
Step 5: Perform text clustering (unsupervised learning). Various methods can be used, such as LDA or BERT-based embeddings. LDA is more effective for long documents. BERT embeddings are suitable for shorter texts and do not require preprocessing
Step 6: Summarize each cluster using a text summarization model (e.g., BART or Pegasus)
